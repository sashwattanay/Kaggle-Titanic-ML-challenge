Here’s the meaning of the column labels from the Titanic dataset:

	•	survival: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
	•	pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
	•	sex: Gender of the passenger
	•	Age: Age in years
	•	sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
	•	parch: Number of parents/children aboard
	•	ticket: Ticket number
	•	fare: Passenger fare
	•	cabin: Cabin number
	•	embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)



For submitting your predictions for the Titanic competition, you need to provide a CSV file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. The file should contain two columns:

	1.	PassengerId: You can sort this in any order.
	2.	Survived: Your binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).

Make sure there are no extra columns or rows in your submission file. Let me know if you’d like assistance in creating this file!


============================


Summary of Data Cleaning Steps:

	1.	Fill missing values (e.g., for Age or Embarked).
	2.	Convert categorical columns to numerical (e.g., “male” to 0, “female” to 1).
	3.	Optionally, scale numerical features for models that require it (Logistic Regression, for example).
	4.	Optionally, create new features like FamilySize to enrich the dataset.
